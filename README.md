## Description

**_Hangman: Ice-Cream Flavour Edition_** is a twist on the classic hangman game. In this version, various ice-cream flavour names form the treasury of words that players must try to guess from. The game leverages ReactJS for building interactive user interfaces, ensuring a smooth gameplay experience. CSS is utilised to integrate custom chalkboard-style fonts and backgrounds that trigger an authentic experience, created through visual and textural cues. Prepare for a wave of nostalgia as you reminisce the games of hangman played on classroom chalkboards during your school days.

While this project currently only features an **_Ice-Cream Flavour Edition_**, future updates will expand the range of topics ("editions") to include a variety of themes to comprehensively provide the game with both entertainment and educational value.
